Contributing
============

There are many tasks that need completing before this can even be considered
useful:

  - [x] Students should be able to select the modules they wish to take
  - [x] Students should be able to select their degree scheme as this alters
        which modules are core and what optional modules are available.
  - [x] Add pre-requisite & provides to module yaml file.
  - [ ] Modules should grey-out as they become unavailable.
  - [ ] We need a good way of handling the placement of modules on screen
        so that related modules are placed near each other so that we dont have
        a mess.
