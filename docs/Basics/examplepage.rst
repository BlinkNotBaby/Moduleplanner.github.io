An Example Docs Page
====================

This is an example docs page.

This shows how to make lists:

* First item of a list
	- 1st item in a list within a list
	- and another one
	- An another
* Second item of a list
* Third item
    - Another list in a list.

This is how you type code::

    for i in xrange(50):
        a = i ** 3
        if i % 2 == 0:
            print i
