Setting the more-info and free-standing links
====================================================

The more-info link
===================
**DISCLAIMER** *The set up of the more-info link assumes that exists a online
version of your schools module handbook* **DISCLAIMER**

You will find the URL for the each module in two places. The part that is the
same for each link can be found in the :code:`settings.yml` file under the
option :code:`info` and the part that is different for each module can be found
in the :code:`module.yml` file under the option :code:`short-link`.

The free-standing link
=======================
This link is found on the homepage of the website and should therefore be a link
to the page on the universities website that students will go to when they are
applying to see what the degree they want to do will be like.

You can the URL for this in the :code:`settings.yml` file under the option
:code:`free`.
